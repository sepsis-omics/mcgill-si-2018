# Bandage

Bandage is a program to visualize a genome assembly. Link to [code on github.](http://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/)

## Start
- Open your mGVL dashboard and click on the link to the Lubuntu desktop.
- A web window should appear called "noVNC". This shows the virtual desktop.
- Open the Terminal in this VNC. type in: `/mnt/gvl/apps/bandage/Bandage`

- The Bandage window will appear.

## Input data
- Click on <ss>File: Load graph</ss>. Select a graph to upload.
- FIXME: put in example bacterial genome graph with a feature that bandage reveals.  E.g. a FASTG output file from Spades.

## Run Bandage
- Under <ss>Graph drawing</ss>, click on <ss>Draw graph</ss>.
- A graph of the contigs and their connections will appear.

FIXME: add a series of steps that can be done that will show some important feature.
e.g.

- <ss>Graph display</ss>: *Colour by read depth*
- <ss>Node labels</ss>, check box next to <ss>Read depth</ss>.
- select some nodes
- <ss>Output</ss>: *Web BLAST selected nodes*
etc.

## Output
- <ss>Output</ss>: *Save entire graph to GFA*

(FIXME: where does this save; what can you use it for next).
