# Overview - Advanced Training

This section contains training modules for microbial genomics analyses. All analyses are performed using the microbial GVL (and occasionally, additional web-based tools), via the Galaxy interface or using the commandline.


1. Genome assembly: from raw DNA sequence reads to assembled genome.
    - [in Galaxy](assembly/assembly_galaxy.md) - using Illumina data
    - on the commandline - using Illumina data
    - in the mGVL SMRTPortal - using PacBio data
    - on the commandline - using both PacBio data and Illumina data

2. Genome annotation: from assembled genome to annotated genome.
    - [in Galaxy](annotation/anno_galaxy.md)
    - on the commandline

3. Core and pan genomes: from assembled genomes to lists of shared genes and accessory genes.
    - [on the commandline](pan/roary.md)

4. Differential gene expression: from raw RNA sequence reads from two conditions to a list of differentially expressed genes.
    - in Galaxy
