# BWA-MEM in Galaxy


## Introduction

This tool is used to find variants. (Note: BWA-MEM can also be used to map sequence reads to a reference for the purposes of assembly.) BWA stands for "Burrows-Wheeler Aligner"; more information and manual [here](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/).

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:

1. map reads to reference using BWA-MEM, and
2. identify variants in the output files.
