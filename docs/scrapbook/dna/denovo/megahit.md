# Megahit

cmdline

This tutorial demonstrates how to assemble genomic reads from bacteria found in environmental samples. [FIXME: is that correct?]

[Megahit on Github](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit#getting-started)

## Pre-requisites
- mGVL instance
- knowledge: cmdline
- knowledge: metagenomics

## Start
- open your mGVL in terminal
- make a folder for the Megahit analsyses: `mkdir Megahit`
- move into this folder: `cd Megahit`

## Input data
- We will use Illumina paired-end reads from several species [FIXME?]


## Run Megahit

```bash
megahit [options] R1reads.fastq R2reads.fastq
```


## Output
