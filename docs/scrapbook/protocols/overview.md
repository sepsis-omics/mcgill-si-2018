# Overview

FIXME: ideas - but we can delete this section if we want

- Workflows in Galaxy, with flowcharts
- Command line pipelines, make flowcharts
- Show various options at each stage (e.g. use tool x or y)

Exemplar pipelines e.g.

- DNA reads to genome (llumina)
	e.g. FastQC, trimmomatic, Spades, view

- DNA reads to genome (PacBio)
	e.g. PacBio smrt portal

- DNA reads to annotated genome
e.g. FastQC, trimmomatic, Spades, Prokka, view

- DNA reads to variants
	e.g. FastQC, trimmomatic, snippy, view

- several sets of DNA reads to genomes: core/pan
	e.g. FastQC, trimmomatic, Spades, Prokka, Roary, phandango

- several sets of DNA to compare structural variants
	e.g. FastQC, trimmomatic, Spades, Mauve

- RNA reads to list of DGE
	e.g. xxx
