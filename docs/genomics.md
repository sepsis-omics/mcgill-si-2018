# Overview

This section contains tutorials for basic microbial genomics analyses in
Galaxy.  These have been designed to be done sequentially.

1. [Use the Galaxy Platform](modules/galaxy/index.md):
a web-based interface for bioinformatic analyses.

2. [Import tutorial data to Galaxy](modules/data-dna/index.md): 
a set of files to use in these introductory tutorials.

3. [Quality control of Illumina data](modules/fastqc/index.md):
assess raw Illumina data for quality issues.

4. [Assemble a genome with Spades](modules/spades/index.md):
assemble raw Illumina sequence reads into a draft bacterial genome sequence
using the tool "Spades".

5. [Annotate a genome with Prokka](modules/prokka/index.md):
describe the type and location of proteins and other features on the draft
bacterial genome sequence using the tool "Prokka".

6. [Find variants with Snippy](modules/snippy/index.md):
identify differences (such as nucleotide mutations) between genomes using
the tool "Snippy".
