Note, Prokka uses a two-step process for the annotation of protein coding regions: first, protein coding regions on the genome are identified using \nProdigal\n; second, the \nfunction\n of the encoded protein is predicted by similarity to proteins in one of many protein or protein domain databases.

While it can be used to view any genomic data, it is specifically designed for viewing bacterial or viral genomes. A variety of file types can be loaded and viewed using Artemis; these include FASTA, EMBL, GenBank and GFF3 format files.\n\n\nLearning objectives\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n\n\n\n\ninstall Artemis on your laptop\n\n\ndownload a bacterial genome sequence, and\n\n\nopen the genome sequence in Artemis and look at the sequence features.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Artemis\n\n\n\n\nArtemis is available at no cost from the Sanger Institute Website.\n\n\nInstructions for downloading and installing Artemis can be found at: \nhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis\n\n\nDownload and run.\n\n\nNot working?

The type species for this genus is yellow fever virus, and the genus includes dengue virus, west nile virus and zika virus.\n\n\nViruses from this genus have a single-segment genome of about 11 kb. Within this, there is a 10 kb open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein. Following translation, this protein is modified to yield the various, mature structural and non-structural viral proteins as illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 - An overview of a typical flavivirus genome and the viral proteins that are part of the viral polyprotein (from \nViralzone\n).\n\n\nThere are 14 complete Murray Valley encephalitis virus genome sequences available at NCBI Viral Genomes.\n\n\n\n\nGo to NCBI \nViral Genomes\n.\n\n\nSelect \nBrowse viral genomes by family\n and click on the family \nFlaviviridae\n: \nComplete Genomes\n\n\nNote: you may have to widen your screen to see all the columns of viral family names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the row for Murray Valley encephelitis virus.
